          <p><b>Scott Pilgrim</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Out titular 22 year-old hero. Well..."hero" might be too strong a
            word: one of the first things we see him do in book 1 is cheat on
            poor Knives! Although he starts (and let's be honest, ends) the
            novels as not the greatest person in the world, his clear love for
            Ramona and acts throughout the series easily redeem him in our eyes
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="rft">
          <p><b>Ramona Flowers</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Just who is Ramona Flowers? This is a question that gets asked a lot
            during the series, and by the end of the book we're not really
            closer to any answers. What we can say is that she's one of the most
            iconic female comic book characters for severl reasons: She's funny,
            kicks ass, and has a magical handbag that acts as a portal to her
            own head.

        <div id="wwt">
          <p><b>Wallace Wells</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ah Wallace, where do we begin? Wallace's cool, calm, and sarcastic
            demenour is the perfect counterbalance to Scott's nervous energy. He
            has arguably the most funny one-liners in the entire series and is a
            delight whenever he's on the page. Also did you know he's gay???
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kpt">
          <p><b>Kim Pine</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            "If your life had a face, I'd punch it in the balls" is one famous
            line that Kim says to Scott early in the series, and this sums up
            her character perfectly. She's the "moody" one of the group, but to
            chalk her up to just that is to miss all of her deep character
            traits and surprisingly touching backstory with Scott. Also who can
            forget "WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! 1 2 3 4!"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sst">
          <p><b>Steven Stills</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Is Steven the only normal character out of the main cast? It sure
            seems like it at times when th rest of the gang if fighting in
            libraries or destroying supermarkets with vegan powers. All he wants
            to do is make an album but stuff keeps getting in the way! We feel
            for you Steven, we really do.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="ynt">
          <p><b>Young Neil</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Young Neil seems to only exists to provide occasional exposition and
            to fill in certain plot necessaties, but you know what? That's OK.
            His name is on of the bets running joke sin the series and the
            payoff from that in book 6 is incredible. I don't know where he's
            going after the end of the series, but I hope it's far, I really do.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="eat">
          <p><b>Envy Adams</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We hear about Envy way before we actually meet her in book 3: after
            all, her and Scott's breakup is one of the biggest reasons that
            Scott is the way he is. She's painted as a villain through and
            through but by the end of the series you realise that that isn't the
            case, and that a certain Mr Pilgrim is unreliable in his
            recollection of events.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kct">
          <p><b>Knives Chau</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Knives is such an innocent character who you feel sorry for at the
            beggining of the series. First of all she falls head-over-heels for
            Scott , then she gets cheated on, then her favourite artist is a
            terrible person, then her dad tries to kill the boy she's pining
            over. She wouldn't hurt a fly. I mean, except for the time she tries
            to kill rmaona in cold blood like. Wallace was right though, she
            deserved better than Scott.
